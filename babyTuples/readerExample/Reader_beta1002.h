//
// At this point, I'd like to take a moment to speak to you about ROOT and TTrees.
//
// ROOT does not make the life of physicists easier. Such a quality would mean that
// the framework you are using does not require expert skills in C/C++ programming and
// pointer handling to achieve what is supposed to be a basic feature. Here, I just
// want to access the TLorentzVector stored in my TTree. Turns out, when you want to
// read a float, it's okay, just give the pointer to the float. But here, you want to
// read a object inherited from TObject, therefore you have to give the *address* of a 
// pointer. - Why ? - I understand that the internal structure might require such a thing,
// but I think it would really be much easier for everybody to find an other way to 
// implement this, instead of letting every single user go through twenty different 
// forums to figure out this small detail that makes everything more complicated.
//
// Now, I want to try to keep my code clean, which is also something ROOT doesn't help to.
// The best solution I found right now is to have this additional structure taking care 
// of the intermediate pointers, and then remap the content to the babyEvent member that I
// actually want it to go to, every time I read a new event.
